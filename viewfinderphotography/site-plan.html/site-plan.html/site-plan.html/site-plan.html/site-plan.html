      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Meet Eliza, the heart and soul behind ViewFinder Photography. The youngest of nine siblings, Eliza was raised in a tight-knit family in a small coastal town in Oregon, where she developed her keen eye for photography from a young age. Growing up surrounded by breathtaking natural beauty, she quickly became captivated by the way light, color, and perspective could transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. Her passion for capturing the world around her evolved into a lifelong pursuit, one that has led her to create timeless images that tell unique stories. Now based in Idaho, Eliza continues to share her love for photography with clients near and far. Whether it’s a scenic landscape, a candid portrait, or an adventurous shoot, she believes every moment deserves to be captured in its most authentic and beautiful form. While Eliza’s heart is rooted in the Pacific Northwest, she’s always ready to travel to bring your vision to life—no location is too far for her camera lens.
