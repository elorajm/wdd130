 <h2>Elora Mathias</h2>
 <p>Hello! I grew up on the coast of Oregon but now I live in South Dakota. Its was a big change from ocean views to rolling prairies but, I absolutely love it. My husband and I have two amazing girls and two very goofy German Shepherds.  </p> 
<p>I took a break from school for several years and this is my first semester back.
        I am majoring in Software Development. </p> 
<p>For fun I like to restore classic cars and antiques with my husband. 
        Go for hikes with our dogs and chase after the girls at all their activities.</p>
<p>Currently I work as a cosmetologist.
    I love visiting with people well working on their hair and hope that I bring a little sunshine to their lives. </p>
<p>I can't wait to get to learn more about everyone!</p>
